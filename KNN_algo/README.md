# K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

### Cricket Player Performance Dataset

This dataset contains information on the performance of 70 cricket players across five different variables: Batting Average, Bowling Average, Runs Scored, Wickets Taken, and Result.


## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Algorithm

We applied the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to this dataset and achieved an accuracy of 100%. The dataset has 70 rows and 5 columns (including the target variable, Result).

KNN is a classification algorithm that works by identifying the k-nearest data points to a given observation and predicting the class of the observation based on the majority class of its k-nearest neighbors.

By applying the KNN algorithm to this cricket player performance dataset, we were able to predict the outcomes of matches with perfect accuracy. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the KNN algorithm for classification tasks, particularly when working with well-defined and well-labeled datasets.

## Description of Variables

- Batting Average: the average number of runs scored by a player per innings played.
- Bowling Average: the average number of runs conceded by a player per wicket taken.
- Runs Scored: the total number of runs scored by a player over the course of the dataset.
- Wickets Taken: the total number of wickets taken by a player over the course of the dataset.
- Result: the outcome of the match (win, loss, or draw).
